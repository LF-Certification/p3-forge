# CODEOWNERS file for sandbox-images repository
#
# This file defines who can approve changes to different parts of the repository.
# Files outside the images/ directory require team approval to prevent unauthorized
# modifications to the build pipeline and infrastructure.
#
# See: https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/about-code-owners
#
# REQUIRED BRANCH PROTECTION SETUP:
# To fully protect this repository, configure these branch protection rules for 'main':
#
# 1. Require pull request reviews before merging:
#    ✅ Required approving reviews: 1
#    ✅ Require review from CODEOWNERS: ENABLE
#    ✅ Dismiss stale reviews when new commits are pushed: ENABLE
#
# 2. Require status checks to pass before merging:
#    ✅ Require branches to be up to date before merging: ENABLE
#    ✅ Required status checks: lint (from dev-build workflow)
#
# 3. Require conversation resolution before merging: ENABLE
#
# This ensures infrastructure changes require platform-engineering approval while
# allowing anyone to contribute to the images/ directory without restrictions.

# Infrastructure and pipeline files - require team approval
